Connection Process for Arduino, TCS3200, and RGB LEDs
This guide outlines the connection process for setting up the Arduino with the TCS3200 color sensor and RGB LEDs as specified in the Arduino code.

Components Required:
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
TCS3200 color sensor
3 RGB LEDs (common cathode or anode, based on your preference)
220-ohm resistors (for the RGB LEDs)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Wiring Instructions:
Connect the TCS3200 Color Sensor:

S0 (Pin 4): Connect to Arduino digital pin 4. This pin is used to set the frequency scaling.
S1 (Pin 5): Connect to Arduino digital pin 5. This pin also helps in frequency scaling.
S2 (Pin 6): Connect to Arduino digital pin 6. This pin selects the color filter for red/green.
S3 (Pin 7): Connect to Arduino digital pin 7. This pin selects the color filter for blue.
Sensor Out (Pin 8): Connect to Arduino digital pin 8. This pin outputs the frequency that corresponds to the detected color.
VCC: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino to power the sensor.
GND: Connect to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino.
Connect the RGB LEDs:

Red LED:
Connect the anode (longer leg) of the red LED to Arduino digital pin 9.
Connect the cathode (shorter leg) through a 220-ohm resistor to GND.
Green LED:
Connect the anode of the green LED to Arduino digital pin 10.
Connect the cathode through a 220-ohm resistor to GND.
Blue LED:
Connect the anode of the blue LED to Arduino digital pin 11.
Connect the cathode through a 220-ohm resistor to GND.
Final Checks:
Ensure all connections are secure and double-check the pin assignments to match the provided Arduino code.
Power the Arduino through a USB connection to your computer or an external power supply.
Code Upload:
After completing the wiring, upload the provided Arduino code to your board using the Arduino IDE. This code initializes the sensor and continuously reads RGB values, controlling the corresponding LEDs based on the detected color.
By following these instructions, you can successfully set up the TCS3200 color sensor with Arduino and RGB LEDs, allowing you to detect and visualize colors in real time.
